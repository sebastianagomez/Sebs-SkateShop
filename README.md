# Sebs - SkateShop

My e-commerce web site with React JS.

My web page is an Skate ecommerce.It is based on the sales of skateboards, clothes, shoes and accessories. 

Each product has its description with the opportunity to add to the cart as many products as you want depending on whether there is stock.
